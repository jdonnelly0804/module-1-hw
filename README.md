## *Overview and Origin:*
The name of the project I chose was **GMX.IO**. This decentralized exchange was created in September of 2021. Due to the nature of this decentralized platform, the founders of this project are currently anonymous. The idea for the project came about due to the need of a platform that allows spot and perpetual leverage trading that is decentralized. Many in the crypto community are in the community solely for its decentralized nature. Currently, it's easiest to trade with leverage on centralized exchanges such as binance. By creating a decentralized exchange that can fulfill this function, theres a large market for those in crypto who would prefer to conduct their trades on this decentralized platform. Finally, due to the decentralized nature, it is unclear of exactly who funded the project.

## *Business Activites:*
The use of a decentralized exchange that can be used for spot and perpetual trading with leverage was designed to solve two problems: The first being to use a diffrent model than the traditional orderbook model that is reliant on market makers. Order books will list the buys/sells that are being offered at each respective price. This model relies on costly incentives for market makers as well as numerous people being active and present on the exchnage to provide liquidity at various prices. Instead, GMX.IO uses an automated market maker (AMM). This model uses liquidity pools that allow digital assets to be traded instead of traditional markets of buyers/sellers. The AMM users supply liquidity pools with a basket of acceptable crypto tokens whose prices are determined by a constant mathematical formula. This solves the first issue of decentralized exchanges typically being illiquid. Secondly, when it comes to using centralized exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, etc), you do not own the keys to your tokens/assets. If the exchange were to fail, anything that you held/owned on that exchange could potentially be lost. In a decentralized exchange, you're in charge of the custody of your tokens/assets. The only loss that could be incurred would be from depreciation of the asset, but you wouldn't have the possibility of losing custody of said tokens.

The companies intended customer would be anyone in the cryptospace with interest in either trading spot/perpetual with leverage, or anyone interested in providing liquidity by staking their tokens to earn yield. GMX can be purchased/used via the Arbitrum or Avalanche blockchain. At the time of writing this, according to GMX's [website](https://stats.gmx.io/), there are currently 83,109 users using Arbitrum and 14,006 users using Avalanche, giving us a total of 97,115 users on the platform.

The solution that GMX offers vs it's competitor is two-fold. First, they offer an AMM that was discussed earlier. Second, as of now, they also use 100% of the fees they generate via trading and actually pass that back to their users. 30% of fees are used to fund those who stake GMX for a yield, and the other 70% goes to their GLP pool, which is their liquidity basket of certain tokens. This way, GMX is simultaneously providing customers with yield, and also helping provide liquidity for their users as well. As more and more users begin to pour in due to the rewards and liquidity, those users consequently also begin to provide liquidity as more users == more fees == more liquidity provided to the GLP pool. Furthermore, GMX also pays out their staking yield in the native token of the chain that you're staking on. For example if you stake GMX using Avalance, you will receive your rewards in AVAX token. If you stake GMX using Arbitrum (L2 of Ethereum), you will receive ETH. Due to this mechanism, you can also reduce your risk by diversifying your staked GMX into different tokens (AVAX/ETH).

Two different types of technology used in GMX include blockchain technology as well as using Chainlink Oracles for dynamic pricing. The blockchain technology is used via Avalanche and Arbitrum as a way to buy GMX token. Chainlink Oracles are used to provide pricing data for the tokens that are included in their liquidity pool. By using Chainling Oracles for pricing, the AMM has dynamic pricing that are used on aggregated data across many exchanges, allowing large wicks from liquidations to be less severe on the liquidity pool pricing.

## *Landscape:*
The domain of the project is in the blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Major trennd and innovations within this domain include decentralized peer to peer transactions, major innovations in privacy within transactions (tornado cash), the overall development of web3 (taking ownership of ones own data),etc. Some other major companies in this domain include Coinbase, Binance, dYdX, Kucoin, kraken, and many more.
